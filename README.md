# Code-Pencil-using-Maven

For this project I used Test Driven Development to solve the Code Pencil Kata Found Here (https://github.com/PillarTechnology/kata-pencil-durability)

To run this project you can use Maven.

mvn install    will build the project

java -cp target/mt-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.sean.dunn.App  will run the App (build the project first to see recent changes)

mvn test will run all of the test cases for the CodePencilClass.


You may also use an ide if you choose.
